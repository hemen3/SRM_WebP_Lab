			<h4>After these steps, you are finally ready to board your flight. Even so, ensure you follow these precautions:</h4>

			<hr><h3>Guidelines to Follow after Flight Take-off</h3>
			<h4>You should stick to safety guidelines even when the flight has taken off. Here are some ways in which you can ensure protection from the virus in such a situation.</h4>	
				<ul>
					<li>Avoid face-to-face interactions as much as possible.</li>
					<br><li>Limit the use of washroom facilities and remain seated for as much of the flight as possible.</li>
					<br><li>Airlines will not serve any meals during the domestic flights, initially. However, you will receive water bottles.</li>
					<br><li>No food consumption is allowed on flights.</li>
				</ul>
			<hr><h3>Guidelines for De-boarding</h3>
			<p>Once the flight reaches the destination, passengers will need to de-board in the same fashion in which they boarded. Ensure that you maintain social distancing norms and proper sanitation during this stage of the journey as well. Use trolleys only when absolutely necessary since these can carry germs left behind by its last users.</p>
