		<h1>What you need to know about Domestic Travel Guidelines in India...</h1>
			<h4>If you are looking to travel by air soon,<br> keep in mind to follow the guidelines mentioned below:</h4>
			<h3>Reaching the airport from your origin point</h3>
			<p>Let us take a look at some factors that you must keep in mind while travelling from your home/hotel/office to the airport.</p>
				<ul>
				
					<li>Download baggage tags and identification numbers. Print out the same and attach it with your luggage.</li>
					<br><li>Keep in mind that you can only carry one handbag and one check-in luggage presently. However, more freedom may likely be offered in this regard in the near future.</li>
					<br><li>You must wear all pieces of protective gear, such as masks and gloves before entering the airport terminal. Do not open your face masks at any time during the journey.</li>
					<br><li>Reach the airport at least two hours before the scheduled departure of your flight. Due to the additional guidelines, check-in and boarding can take longer.</li>
					<br><li>Individuals who stay in containment zones or who test positive for the virus are prohibited from travelling on domestic flights for the time being. Boarding a flight by defying either of these rules can lead to severe penal action.</li>
					<br><li>All passengers must submit a self-declaration form regarding their health, along with their Aarogya Setu app health data to certify themselves as being fit to fly.</li>
				</ul> 
			<hr><h3>Guidelines to Reach Terminal Building</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Get down from the vehicle while wearing protective gears and ensure you have all the necessary documents on your phone.</li>
					<br><li>Reach the thermal screening area near the entry gate and undergo temperature checking. You would also need to display your health status through the Aarogya Setu App at this time.</li>
					<br><li>Next, move to the CISF kiosk and display your ID and boarding pass to enter the terminal premises.</li>
					<br><li>After baggage check-in, you will receive an SMS confirmation regarding the receipt of your bags. Generally, this confirmation is issued to travellers on paper.</li>
				</ul>
			<hr><h3>Guidelines for Proceeding through Airport Security</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Every airport will include security-screening facilities prior to boarding the flight. You will need to follow all directives in an orderly fashion.</li>
					<br><li>There is no cause for worry, as security personnel will follow a contactless procedure even while performing physical checks on a passenger.</li>
				</ol>
			<hr><h3>Guidelines for Security Hold Area</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Maintain social distancing with other passengers who are waiting for their flights.</li>
					<br><li>Avoid sitting on chairs marked ‘not for use’ to maintain desirable distance from others.</li>
					<br><li>If you intend to visit F&B outlets, ensure that you follow proper sanitisation and social distancing norms there as well.</li>
					<br><li>Dispose of all used tissues, napkins, gloves and masks in covered yellow-coloured disposable bins.</li>
				</ul>
			<hr><h3>Guidelines for Boarding the Aircraft</h3>
			<h4>After these steps, you are finally ready to board your flight. Even so, ensure you follow these precautions:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>You must collect the face masks, face shield and sanitisers from the boarding gate. Wear the mask and shield, and sanitise your hands thoroughly before boarding the flight.</li>
					<br><li>Passengers will self-scan their boarding pass to limit contact with airport staff members.</li>
					<br><li>You and other passengers will board the aircraft in an orderly fashion, limiting any commotion in the process.</li>
				</ul>
			<hr><h3>Guidelines to Follow after Flight Take-off</h3>
			<h4>You should stick to safety guidelines even when the flight has taken off. Here are some ways in which you can ensure protection from the virus in such a situation.</h4>	
				<ul>
					<li>Avoid face-to-face interactions as much as possible.</li>
					<br><li>Limit the use of washroom facilities and remain seated for as much of the flight as possible.</li>
					<br><li>Airlines will not serve any meals during the domestic flights, initially. However, you will receive water bottles.</li>
					<br><li>No food consumption is allowed on flights.</li>
				</ul>
			<hr><h3>Guidelines for De-boarding</h3>
			<p>Once the flight reaches the destination, passengers will need to de-board in the same fashion in which they boarded. Ensure that you maintain social distancing norms and proper sanitation during this stage of the journey as well. Use trolleys only when absolutely necessary since these can carry germs left behind by its last users.</p>
